This is a project for importing open data from Health Canada's [website](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca) into R.

The project structure is derived from [Project Template](http://www.projecttemplate.net).

Currently the `src` directory has import scripts for the following datasets:

* The Drug Product Database
* The Notice of Compliance Database
* Summary Basis of Decisions
* The Patent Register
* Canada Vigilance
* The Licenced Natural Health Products Database
